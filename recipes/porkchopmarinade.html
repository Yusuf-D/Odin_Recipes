    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best pork chop marinade I've ever tasted. I starting throwing things together in a bowl and I'm so
        glad I wrote it down...try this! Flavor is best when pork is grilled.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large pork chops</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mesquite-flavored seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut each pork chop from one side through the middle horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open
            the two sides and spread them out like an open book.</li>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, thyme, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce,
            vinegar, mesquite seasoning, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a bowl and pour into a large resealable
            plastic bag. Add pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in
            the refrigerator, 6 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>ncrease amount of marinade if cooking a larger portion.
            To grill chops, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill chops until
            nicely browned on each side and the meat is slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let
            rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
