    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bread flour is the best flour for homemade pizza dough. You can use all-purpose flour instead of the bread flour
        called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier
        crust for your pizza. Pizza dough is a yeasted dough that requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the
        expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work. Also, if the yeast does
        not begin to foam or bloom within 10 minutes of being added to the water in Step 1 of
        Making the Pizza Dough, it is probably dead. You'll need to start over with new, active yeast.</p>
    
        <p>Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and
        level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is
        the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.</p>
