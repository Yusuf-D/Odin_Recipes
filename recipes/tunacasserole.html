    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tons of fresh herbs add flavor to this easy skillet tuna casserole made with peas, cremini mushrooms, and two
        types of cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package yolk-free egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups peas</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can water-packed tuna, drained and flaked</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until
            tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
            Add mushrooms, peas, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
            Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the vegetables; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add milk and chicken broth and bring to a
            simmer. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Add drained egg noodles to the vegetable mixture, along with Cheddar cheese, tuna, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese,
            parsley, dill, chives, and lemon juice; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan with panko and 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle over the casserole.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 17 to 19 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
